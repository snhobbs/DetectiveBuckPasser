      There you are piss drunk, shuffling down the street on a Tuesday parting the rats, cockroaches, and old newspapers like Moses parting the red sea, that is if you count the people you're leading as the almost finished 18 pack of Schaefer in your hand and a lingering question of if you should chase the last one down with a bullet.
But there's no time to finally finish something, someone stops you in your path flashing a switchblade demanding money. You pause.
