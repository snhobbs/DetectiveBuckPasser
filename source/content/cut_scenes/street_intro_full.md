      There you are piss drunk, shuffling down the street on a Tuesday parting the rats, cockroaches, and old newspapers like Moses parting the red sea, that is if you count the people you're leading as the almost finished 18 pack of Schaefer in your hand and a lingering question of if you should chase the last one down with a bullet.
But there's no time to finally finish something, someone stops you in your path flashing a switchblade demanding money. You pause.

As you finish smashing the last bottle over the man's head everything comes back into focus, Ray's is open for another hour. After finishing 2 slices and cleaning the blood off in the bathroom you decide to start the shuffle back home. There's so much to do tomorrow, and you don't want anything to do with it.

You walk up the stairs to your apartment and go to bed, hopefully the bats are already sleeping.
