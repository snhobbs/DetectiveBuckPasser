insert into cutScene values(2,"The Bowery, Tchotch-Naughts Bodega, 12:34pm","You stumble down the dark stairway sporting yesterdays clothes and last weeks odor. You’re not sure if it’s broken glass, potato chips or bone but the stairs crunch and crackle under foot. The only thing guiding you through the darkness is a dim light glowing at the end of the stairs.
^Walking into the bodega below you see the man that you'd detest if you were still capable of emotional response, the landlord, you owe him the rent.
^There he is, John F Kennedy, a reconstructed abomination of the 35th President of the United States. You’re not sure if he is the real JFK, but you don't do your job at work so why start on the off hours?
^He's yelling at a film of Apollo 11 coverage while cutting Macy’s security tags off of a haul of Hawaiian shirts and putting them on the sales rack. The mechanical jaw the hack surgeons gave him needs more oil. If this store didn't sell Schaefer it'd be a complete wash.
^Just give him the rent and don't look at Armstrong on the screen, you have no energy for that again.");
